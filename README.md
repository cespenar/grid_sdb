# grid_sdb

Sample scripts and settings used for modelling subdwarf B stars with the MESA code. They were utilized to calculate models discussed in the paper [*Evolutionary modelling of sdB stars using MESA with the predictive mixing and convective premixing schemes*](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv201114621O/abstract). The setup utilizes [MesaScript](https://github.com/wmwolf/MesaScript) and is meant to be run on the BEM cluster provided by [WCSS](https://www.wcss.pl).

## Disclaimer

This is an ongoing project and hence some MESA settings provided here may be slightly different than those used in the paper.
