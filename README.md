Sample scripts and settings used for modelling subdwarf B stars with the MESA code. The setup utilizes MesaScript and is meant to be run on the BEM cluster provided by www.wcss.pl

## Disclaimer

This is an ongoing project and hence some MESA settings provided here may be slightly different than those used in the paper *Evolutionary modelling of sdB stars using MESA with the predictive mixing and convective premixing schemes*.
